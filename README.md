# Layered Shading

![LashLayers](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/LaSh/blob/main/images/LashLayers.jpg)

Layered Shading (LaSh) is a bxdf and displacement shader layering/combining system for use with RenderMan. Similar to the <a href="https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/prman_20.Home">Laika Production Shading Library for RenderMan 20</a>, LaSh also incorporates displacement into its definition of a Material so that it can represent a true physical substance. This is in contrast to systems like [MaterialX](https://materialx.org/) and [Lama](https://rmanwiki.pixar.com/display/REN24/MaterialX+Lama), which do not consider a material's physical characteristics, but are instead limited to its optical properties only.

Documentation is on the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/LaSh/wiki/Home).
