# Layered Shading

![LashLayers](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/LaSh/blob/main/images/LashLayers.jpg)

This repository and its associated documentation will be updated to contain the latest reference implementation of the paper *Layering Displaced Materials with Thickness, Accumulation, and Size* when it has been completed.

Layered Shading (LaSh) is a bxdf and displacement shader layering/combining system for use with RenderMan. Similar to the <a href="https://github.com/LaikaStudios/shading-library/wiki/prman_20.Home">Laika Production Shading Library for RenderMan 20</a> from which it is derived, LaSh incorporates bxdfs and displacement into its definition of a Material so that it can represent a true physical substance, and implements a displacement layering capability so LaSh Materials can be easily layered in a physically plausible way.

Documentation is on the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/LaikaStudios/LaSh/wiki/Home).

We'd love you hear what you think, or to discuss any issues or thoughts you may have about this repository and its Layered Shading implementation.
